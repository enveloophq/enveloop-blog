![Using Enveloop with Postmark Header](/img/header-postmark.png)

Our team has been adding some really great features lately. Along with that, we're remaining focused on providing more ways to use Enveloop in the ecosystem, and that includes a continuing expansion of our network of message providers.

The latest: [Postmark](https://postmark.com). ðŸ’¥ðŸŽ‰

We all love how developer-forward Postmark is -- plus, they still find a way to have a fun and engaging platform. Even better -- setting up Enveloop message templates to send messages using your Postmark account is fast and simple.

Here's a quick synopsis of how to do it!

ðŸ’¡All this information, in even greater detail, is available with our: [**Enveloop Docs for the Postmark Integration**](https://docs.enveloop.com/integrations/email-integrations/postmark).

Head over there if you want the full technical detail. This is especially helpful if you want to use Postmark, but don't have a ton of experience in how it all works. *(hey, no worries -- we're always learning!)*

### Setting up Postmark

After logging into your Postmark account:

1. Either access the **Server** you want to use or create a new Server.
2. Choose **Default Transactional Stream**.
3. Choose **Settings** to view the Stream Settings area.
4. Locate and retrieve your **Server API Token**.

Now, time to head over to your Enveloop account and add in the token. 

### Setting up Enveloop

After logging into your Enveloop account:

1. Open the **Team** and **Project** you want use Postmark for sending messages from.
2. Select **Integrations** from the menu on the left.
3. Paste in your Postmark Server API Token.
4. Set your **Default From** email address.

That's it -- now your templates in this project will send messages via Postmark. I mean, seriously, can it get much easier. I'd be skeptical. :)

### Send your First Message

From here, you can go to the **Deploy** tab of one of your message templates and try it out!

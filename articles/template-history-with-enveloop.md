> Enveloop is a developer-focused message builder and API that makes it easy to design &amp; send beautiful emails and texts from your app using one simple implementation. You can [sign up for free](https://app.enveloop.com).

Ever held back from experimenting with your email template designs because you were afraid of losing something important? We're excited to introduce **Template History** in Enveloop â€“ a feature that gives you the freedom to explore new design directions while keeping your previous work just a click, or in our case, a slider away.

### Design Without Limits, Create Without Fear

Template Timeline transforms how you approach email design by eliminating the "what if I mess this up?" worry. Now you can:

- Freely experiment with bold new designs
- Try different copy variations without losing your original text
- Test new layouts knowing you can always go back
- Keep a living archive of your design evolution
- Revisit seasonal designs from last year

Your design history is a treasure trove of ideas and sometimes your best inspiration for something new comes from your own past work. Template History allows you to use a slider to drift back in time and see how your user communication has evolved.

### Perfect for Creative Teams

For bigger teams using Enveloop, Template History can work like a shared design system. You can:

- Browse through design iterations for inspiration
- Reference past versions during creative discussions
- Learn from historical changes and improvements
- Maintain brand consistency by referencing previous work

Plus, if any work is mistakenly overwritten, it's super-easy to pull back the last good design and progress forward.

### How It Works

**1. Update your Email Templates.** Edit the content and design of your email templates. Enveloop monitors everything and keeps a running history of your changes.

**2. Open Template History.** Scroll through your template's evolution with our visual timeline interface. You can see all your changes, displayed in the proper media format, and find what you are looking for.

**3. Restore Instantly.** Found a version you want to revisit? You have the option to restore your design to the current template or create a new template from that point in history. Simple.

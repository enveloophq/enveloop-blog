We're excited to launch **Themes** for Enveloop! Themes allows you create and manage color settings across all your Enveloop message templates. This empowers your design efforts and simplifies design &amp; branding controls.

With Enveloop Themes, you can now:

- Create color themes for your message templates.
- Apply consistent design/branding as you build.
- Move themes from one template to another.
- Update colors globally, allowing you to try new design ideas.
- Find where all your template colors are used.

But, what's *really powerful* about themes – colors used in themes have **assigned names** and these names are accessible via the Enveloop API. This means you can update the design of a message as you are sending it. For example: With a base template design in place, you can alter the template in real-time to use the design, branding, and logos of your customer. Check out the [Enveloop API Docs](https://docs.enveloop.com/enveloop-api/core-api-endpoints/post-messages) for more info!

Here are some highlights!

### It's Simple to Add and Edit Themes

Now, in Enveloop, you can centralize and define all your colors. This makes it easy to update colors as your design changes. Also, you have contextual awareness of the colors you do use in your templates – providing you consistency and structure, especially as different team members make updates to your message templates

All your colors are located in an accessible theme toolbox, available to be used.

### Extend Themes to All Your Templates

With theme copy and paste, once you have created a theme, you can easily move it from one template to the next. This allows you to consistently apply your design and branding elements across all your emails and texts.

### So, where are all these colors used?

For all the colors that you have in your theme, you can roll over each one to see all the places the color is currently used in your email template. This helps you to know what all sections and elements will be affected by any color changes that you make.

### More Themes to Come!

These are a few of the highlights of Theme functionality in Enveloop. We've included detailed [Theme Documentation](https://docs.enveloop.com/product-guides/themes), demonstrating the full capability of this powerful method to manage and extend design and branding on your message templates. 

We'll share additional articles in upcoming releases that highlight interesting ways you can take advantage of the Enveloop API to make real-time changes to your message designs – allowing you dynamic control of your designs. It's powerful!

Happy sending!
